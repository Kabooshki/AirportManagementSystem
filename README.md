# Airport Management System

This is a **Concurrent** representation of how an Airport Management System would work in a real setting. **Mutual Exclusiveness**, **Locks**, **Thread Safety**, and **Resource Allocation** are the main learning points from this project for me and I hope it would help you see how concurrency works at a basic to intermediate level.

## How to Run:

1. Install **NetBeans** IDE
2. Clone this repo
3. Open NetBeans and **Open a project** where the repo 'Deliverable' is
4. Run **test.java**

## Note

The program runs **infintely**, so you would need to **manually stop the program** in order to read through the terminal logs clearly. 

Recommended to run for about **20-30 seconds** to ensure all functions have run more than once and then simply scroll through the logs to see how all threads are working concurrently
